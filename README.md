# shopping-cart-optimization
A MILP formulation of shopping cart optimization.

##Summary
We are in need of a series of products in a recurrent way. They are products that are not
perishable. It means we can stock up as much as we want and there are no expiration dates.
Nevertheless there we have space limitations. A warehouse or storage room, maybe a cupboard, drawer, etc.
We want to buy as much as we can put in our storage facility. Each product though is spent in a different rate.

##Objective
The objective of the problem is to reduce our visits to the supermarket.
